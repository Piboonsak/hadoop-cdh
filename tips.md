## Markdown Style Guide for [about.GitLab.com]

This website was generated by [Middleman], a blog-aware Static Site Generator ([SSG]) widely used by web developers.
[Markup language] is part of the structure of any SSG. It is a system to write documents making them somehow
syntactically distinguishable from text. [Lightweight markup languages] have a simplified and unobtrusive syntax,
designed to be easily written within any text editor. That's what we use to write our content. The majority of
SSGs use markdown engines for this purpose. Read through our blog post on [Modern Static Site Generators][ssgs-post]
to understand how they work.

For [about.GitLab.com], we use [kramdown], which is an advanced markdown engine with a lot of interesting features that
most of the other engines don't have.

If you never have written a single line in markdown markup, don't worry, it's easy to learn and even easier to use. You'll
probably be surprised how handy it is once you get used to it. And you'll miss it whenever the tech you're using doesn't support
markdown.

In most of GitLab text areas you'll find markdown support. Not all of them run with kramdown, so the markup will not
behave equally "GitLabwide". For **GitLab.com**, **GitLab CE** and **GitLab EE** text areas, the markdown engine is currently
[Redcarpet]. Here you can find the [markdown style guide][gitlab-markdown] for them.

This guide has been made to make it easier for everyone to use kramdown features and save a lot of time writing content for
[about.GitLab.com], including handbook pages, website pages, blog posts and everything else within the project [www-GitLab-com].

There are different possible syntaxes for most of the markups described below, but this guide is to be considered the
standard for [about.GitLab.com].

## Headings

```md
## Heading h2

### Heading h3

#### Heading h4
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
## Heading h2
{:.no_toc style="margin-top:0"}

### Heading h3
{:.no_toc}

#### Heading h4
{:.no_toc}
</div>
</div>

Notes:

- We don't use `h1` headings, as they already are displayed on every page as its title, and we should not apply more than one `h1` per page.
  > _When you use a top level heading, or an <h1>, you’re setting up a semantic relationship between that heading and the remainder of the content on a page, describing what it is about. If you then use a second <h1> on the same page, you’re creating some potential confusion, because someone, or a search engine might see that as the ending of the semantic relationship between the content after the first <h1> and the start of this new <h1>._ [SEO Guide]
- Always start with `h2` (`##`), and respect the order h2 &rarr; h3 &rarr; h4. Never skip the hierarchy level, such as h2 &rarr; h4.
  > _The six heading elements, H1 through H6, denote section headings. Although the order and occurrence of headings is not constrained by the HTML DTD, documents **should not skip levels** (for example, from H1 to H3), as converting such documents to other representations is often problematic._ [W3C]
- Always leave a blank space between the hash `#` and the text next to it, otherwise it won't render properly.
- For keeping the text clear and the markdown consistent, [jump a line](#jump-a-line) between any heading and its subsequent paragraph.

----

## Paragraphs, breaks, and horizontal lines

Regular paragraphs are obtained by just writing text lines. If you hit **enter** between two lines,
both lines will be joined into a single paragraph, which is called [wrapping text][wrap].
But, if you leave a blank line between them, they will split into two paragraphs.

### Wrapping Text

We usually break the lines within paragraphs to facilitate reviews. Do not leave blank spaces
after the last word of the line broken within a paragraph, unless you want it to be intentionally
broken with a `<br>`.

#### Regular paragraphs and automatic join

```md
This text is a paragraph.
This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

This text is a paragraph.
This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.

</div>
</div>

### Additional breaks

In case you need an additional break (or some extra space between lines), you can simply use the HTML break tag `<br>`,
leaving blank lines above and below it:

```html
Text A
<!-- blank line -->
<br>
<!-- blank line -->
Text B
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Text A

<br>

Text B

</div>
</div>

### Horizontal lines

A sequence of three or more dashes will produce a horizontal line, but let's use always **4** as standard. Leave blank
lines after and before it:

```html
Text
<!-- blank line -->
----
<!-- blank line -->
Text
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Text

----

Text

</div>
</div>

----

## Emphasis: bold and italic

To display bold or italic text, wrap it in stars or underlines:

```md
This is **bold** and this is _italic_.
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">

This is **bold** and this is _italic_.

</div>
</div>

----

## Links

There are a few different ways to display links with markdown markup, but
to keep some standards, let's try to use the following options only.

### Inline Links

We'd rather use inline links, such as `[Text to display](link)`, as they are easier to maintain.
Use relative URLs whenever possible.

### Identifiers

When there are **repeated** links across a single page, you can opt for using identifiers.

Place the identifiers at the end of the paragraph (or the section), arranging them in alphabetical order.

```md
[Text to display][identifier] will display a link.

[Another text][another-identifier] will do the same. Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

[This link] will do the same as well. It works as the identifier itself.

[This link][] (same as above), has a second pair of empty brakets to indicate that the following parenthesis does not contain a link.

<https://example.com> works too. Must be used for explicit links.

<!-- Identifiers, in alphabetical order -->

[another-identifier]: https://example.com "This example has a title"
[identifier]: http://example1.com
[this link]: http://example2.com

```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

[Text to display][identifier] will display a link.

[Another text][another-identifier] will do the same. Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

[This link] will do the same as well. It works as the identifier itself.

[This link][] (same as above), has a second pair of empty brackets to indicate that the following parenthesis does not contain a link.

<https://example.com> works too. Must be used for explicit links.

<!-- Identifiers, in alphabetical order -->

[another-identifier]: https://example.com "This example has a title"
[identifier]: http://example1.com
[this link]: http://example2.com

</div>
</div>

Important notes:
{: #links-important-notes}

- {: #note-identifiers} Identifiers **are not** case sensitive. They can be single words as `[link]` or `[multiple words too]`.
- {: #note-meaningful-links} Don't take it as a restrictive rule, but [avoid using meaningless texts for links][handbook-writing] as "this article"
or "read here". For these examples, it would be better using the article's title (for the first) and
the documentation's subject, for the latter.
- {: #note-deadlinks-checker} Check for broken links: <http://www.deadlinkchecker.com/>

## Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists are very straight-forward to produce. There are a few ways
to produce the same results, but let's stick with the following, again, to maintain
some standards.

Always use **3** blank spaces to indent a nested list (to create sub items).

Tip: don't leave blank lines **between the items**, unless you have a reason to do so.

**Important:** always leave a blank line between the paragraph or heading and the subsequent list!
If you don't, the list will not render.
{:.alert .alert-info}

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists are pretty easy to create. Couldn't be more intuitive:

```md
Paragraph:

1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   2. Sub item two
   3. Sub item three
2. Item two
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">
Paragraph:

1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   2. Sub item two
   3. Sub item three
2. Item two

</div>
</div>

To be practical and avoid errors on the numbers, use "1" for all the items. The markdown engine will output them
in the correct order.

```md
Paragraph:

1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   1. Sub item two
1. Item two
1. Item three
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">
Paragraph:

1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   2. Sub item two
1. Item two
1. Item three

</div>
</div>


### Unordered lists

Unordered lists are very easy to create too:

```md
Paragraph:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
   - Sub item 1
   - Sub item 2
- Item 4
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">
Paragraph:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
   - Sub item 1
   - Sub item 2
- Item 4

</div>
</div>

### Split lists

Let's say, for some reason, you want to split a list in different parts. To do that, use the
markup `^` to indicate the end of a list and the beginning of the next:

```md
- list one - item 1
- list one - item 2
   - sub item 1
   - sub item 2
- list one - item 3
^
- list two - item A
- list two - item A
^
- list three - item _i_
- list three - item _ii_
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">

- list one - item 1
- list one - item 2
   - sub item 1
   - sub item 2
- list one - item 3
^
- list two - item A
- list two - item A
^
- list three - item _i_
- list three - item _ii_

</div>
</div>

## Images

To insert images to your markdown file, use the markup `![ALT](/path/image.ext)`. The path can either
be relative to the website, or a full URL for an external image. The supported formats are
`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`. You might be able to use some `.svg` files too, depending on its structure.

```md
![An awesome example image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png "Image Title")
```

You can also use an identifier, as we do for [links](#links):

```md
![An awesome example image][identifier]
```

If you want to add a caption to your image, it's easily achieved with:

```md
![An awesome example image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png)*My caption*
```

For clickable images, simply wrap the image markup into a [link markup](#links):

```md
[![An awesome example image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png "Hello World")*My caption*][about.gitlab.com]
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

[![An awesome example image](/images/about-gitlab-com.png "Hello World")*My caption*][about.gitlab.com]

</div>
</div>

**Important notes:**
{:#images-important-notes}

- {: #image-shadow} Apply [shadow](#shadow) to your images!
- {: #image-requirements} All images must be placed [under `/source/images/`][source-img], in an appropriate directory. Only screenshots
and public domain images are permitted.
- {: #image-alt-text} The text inside the square brackets is an image attribute called `ALT`, which stands for _alternative text_.
It [must not be left empty][img-seo], but contain something to describe that image. `ALT` is useful for
[visually impaired internauts][visually-impaired], for SEO, and it is displayed when, for some reason, that image is not loaded by the browser.
- {: #image-filename} For the same reasons, the image must contain a name related to it. Example: instead of `image-01.jpg`,
name it `black-dog.jpg`, if it's a photo of a black dog.
- {: #image-title} It's also recommendable adding an image title, as the "Hello World" exemplified above.

----

## Videos

There are two ways of displaying videos: within HTML5 `<video>` tags and within `<iframe>` tags.

### Display videos from YouTube

This method works for YouTube videos and any other embed video within an `<iframe>` tag.

1. Copy the code below and paste it into your markdown file. Leave a blank line above
and below it. **Do NOT edit the code block** (e.g., remove spaces - the video iframe
may not render properly)
1. Go the video URL you want to display
1. Click on "Share", then "Embed"
1. Copy the `<iframe>` source (`src`) URL **only**, and paste it replacing the `src` below:

```html
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

### Display local videos (HTML5)

This method works for any video uploaded to somewhere retrievable from the internet from a URL, or from a relative
path like `path/to/video.mp4`.

1. Read through the [w3schools HTML5 video guide][w3-video], or the [MDN `<video>` guide][mdn-video].
1. Record or export the video in these three formats to achieve cross-browser and cross-device
compatibility: `.mp4`, `.ogg` and `.webm`.
1. Get the URL for your video
1. Choose an image to use as a poster
1. Copy the code below and paste it to your file
1. Replace the `src` URLs for your video URLs

```html
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" poster="path/to/poster_image.png">
    <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="path/to/video.webm" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" poster="/images/default-blog-image.png">
    <source src="html5-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

_**Note:** in case you don't have all formats recommended by **w3schools**, you can use just one of them,
but your video most likely won't be supported in all devices and browsers. The video above (`.mp4` only)
worked on Mozilla Firefox for OS X, Android, and Windows, and on Chrome for Android and for Windows.
But it may not work on other devices/browser, such as Chrome for OS X and iOS, or Safari.
In fact, the best option is using YouTube or Vimeo embed videos in `<iframe>` tags._
{: .note}

### Display other videos

For any other videos, such as from Vimeo or Google Drive, grab the video iframe only, and proceed
like we do for [YouTube videos](#display-videos-from-youtube), wrapping the `<iframe>`
within a `<figure class="video_container">`, for responsiveness. Copy and paste the code below,
replacing **only** the iframe URL with your own:

```html
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

### Display multiple videos

To display multiple videos on the same page, just repeat the `figure` code block
where you want them to show up, replacing the video ID with the respective ID
corresponding to your videos.

To display multiple videos in a sequence, just copy the `figure` code block and
paste it as many times as necessary. Always leave a blank line between the blocks.
Do **NOT** remove the spaces, otherwise your videos may not render properly.

```html
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->
```

## Table of Contents (ToC)

With kramdown, creating a Table of Contents is the easiest thing ever! The automatic ToC will include every heading in
the document, unless you don't want it to be included. You do not need to add anchors individually to every title. This is
an automated process.

```md
----

## On this page
{:.no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

----
```

As always, leave a blank line before and after the markup. Note that there are four dashes beginning
and closing the block, which is not required, but recommendable for keeping the same standards throughout [about.GitLab.com].

The heading "On this page" can be adapted to your case, e.g., "In this tutorial", or "In this guide", etc. It's not required
either, but recommended.

The markup `{:.no_toc}` is used every time you don't want to include a heading into the ToC. Just add
it right below the heading, and it won't be included into the ToC. In fact `no_toc` is a
[custom class](#classes-ids-and-attributes), as described later in this guide.

The **output** ToC can be found at the very beginning of this page.

Alternatively, you can use ordered ToC too, displaying numbers at the beginning of the list. Just use the markup for
ordered lists and kramdown will be smart enough to understand what you want:

```md
1. TOC
{:toc}
```

----

## Tables

Tables for markdown are challenging. So, we have two possible approaches: use markdown whenever possible,
but if you need pretty advanced table layouts, you are free to add them in HTML markup instead.

> _Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. ([John Gruber][daring-quote])_
{: #quote}

As explained by John Gruber, the creator of markdown, it was not created to replace HTML,
so there are situations we can't avoid using HTML. With complex tables, that's the case.

The following table has a header (first line), then markup to define the desired alignment (dashes and colons),
then the table body. You can go ahead and add separators to create subsequent table bodies.

However you prepare your table, its design will depend upon the CSS styles defined for them.

The last markup `{: .custom-class #custom-id}` **can** be used in case you want to attribute 
a [custom class and/or a custom ID](#classes-ids-and-attributes) to the `<table>` element.

```md
| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| First body part | Second cell  | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| Second line     | foo          | **strong**      | baz            |
| Third line      | quux         | baz             | bar            |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Second body     |              |                 |                |
| 2nd line        |              |                 |                |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Third body      |              |                 | Foo            |
{: .custom-class #custom-id}

```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| First body part | Second cell  | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| Second line     | foo          | **strong**      | baz            |
| Third line      | quux         | baz             | bar            |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Second body     |              |                 |                |
| 2nd line        |              | Hello World     |                |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Third body      |              |                 | Foo            |
{: .custom-class #custom-id}

</div>
</div>

<!-- ANOTHER CHANGE NECESSARY TO ADD TO CSS ^^ -->

Certain tools can help you to create your own complex table if you need merging lines or columns,
and more advanced layouts. This is a [Table Generator] that might help you out.

Note that the bars, spaces, and dashes were used symmetrically above just for providing a nice
view of the table markup. The symmetry is not required.

Read through the [kramdown syntax guide][kram-tables] on tables for further information.

----

## Code blocks

There are a few options for displaying code blocks with kramdown. Most of them use backticks ``` ` ```.

### In-line

This is an ``` `in-line` ``` code block.

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_In-line_

This is an `in-line` code block.

</div>
</div>

### Fenced

    ```
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```

_Fenced Highlighted_

    ```ruby
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```

or

    ```
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```
    {: .language-ruby}


<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_Fenced_

```
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```

_Fenced Highlighted_

```ruby
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```

or

```
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```
{: .language-ruby}


</div>
</div>

### Indented

Add 4 white spaces before every line:

        def hello
           puts "Hello world!"
        end

_Indented Highlighted_

        def hello
           puts "Hello world!"
        end
    {: .language-ruby}


<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_Indented_

    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end

_Indented Highlighted_

    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
{: .language-ruby}

</div>
</div>

### Nested

Add 4 white spaces before every line. This is used when you want to display a code block
within a code block.

        ```
        def hello
           puts "Hello world!"
        end
        ```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_Nested_

    ```
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```

</div>
</div>

### In lists

Indent the text of each item in 3 white spaces. Leave blank lines between the code block and the list items,
and ident the code block in 5 white spaces:

    1.   Item 1
    1.   Item 2

         ```ruby
         def hello
            puts "Hello world!"
         end
         ```

    1.   Item 3

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

1.   Item 1
1.   Item 2

     ```ruby
     def hello
        puts "Hello world!"
     end
     ```

1.   Item 3

</div>
</div>

----

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are good resources to mentioning someone else's quotes, like we did [just above](#quote).
Also, can be used to emphasize a sentence or a small paragraph.

```md
> This is a blockquote.
>     On multiple lines.
That may be lazy.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

----

> This is a paragraph.
>
> > A nested blockquote.
>
> ### Headers work
>
> * lists too
>
> and all other block-level **elements**.
>
> Even code blocks:
>
>      def hello
>        puts "Hello world!"
>      end
> {: .language-ruby}

## Notes

```md
This is a regular paragraph.

**Note:** a note is something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context.
{: .note}
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

This is a regular paragraph.

**Note:** a note is something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context.
{: .note}

</div>
</div>

----

## Comments

_Markdown markup_

```md
This is a paragraph
{::comment}
This is a comment which is
completely ignored.
{:/comment}
... paragraph continues here.
```

_Regular HTML markup_

    <!-- This is accepted as a comment too -->
{: .language-html}

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

This is a paragraph
{::comment}
This is a comment which is
completely ignored.
{:/comment}
... paragraph continues here.

<!-- This is accepted as a comment too -->

</div>
</div>

----

## Anchors

Add an anchor anywhere with:

```
[](){: name="hello-world"}

Some text
```

Or simply use an ID:

```
Some text
{: #hello-world}
```
----

## Font Awesome

Yes, we can use fancy [Font Awesome] icons too.

_Regular_

```
### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece" aria-hidden="true"></i> Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle}
```

And you can go further, such as the following.

_Styled_

```
### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece fa-fw" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Purple Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle-purple}

### <i class="fa fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Orange GitLab Tanuki
{: #tanuki-orange}
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_Regular_

### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece" aria-hidden="true"></i> Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle}

----

_Styled_

### <i class="fa fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Purple GitLab Tanuki
{: #tanuki-purple}

### <i class="fa fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Orange GitLab Tanuki
{: #tanuki-orange}

</div>
</div>

When doing something like this to a heading, it's important give it a custom ID (e.g., `{: #puzzle}`),
otherwise the one automatically created by kramdown will sound very awkward.

The class `fa-fw` is used when you want to display the icons as a list. They will be aligned, as well as
the text right beside them.

See live examples [on this post][ssgs-post], where the icons are used to illustrate the text.

-----

## Classes, IDs, and attributes

Defining CSS classes, and elements IDs and attributes with markdown is definitely something unusual (kramdown magic!).

But yes, if you know how to use it, you'll love it! Check how easy it is to do that with kramdown:

```
Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 .class-2}

Paragraph
{: #custom-id}

Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 #custom-id-1}

## Heading
{: .class .class-1 #custom-id-2}

Paragraph
{: .class #custom-id-3 style="padding-top:0" key="value"}

## Heading {#hello}

List:

- {: .class} List item with custom class
- {:#id} List item with custom id

To a [link]{: #link}, in-line.

This is a [link][google-es]{:hreflang="es"} in Spanish.

[link]: https://google.com
[google-es]: https://google.es
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 .class-2}

Paragraph
{: #custom-id}

Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 #custom-id-1}

### Heading
{: .class .class-1 .no_toc #custom-id-2}

Paragraph
{: .class #custom-id-3 style="padding-top:0" key="value"}

### Heading {#hello}
{: .no_toc}

List:

- {: .class} List item with custom class
- {:#id} List item with custom id

To a [link]{: #link}, in-line.

This is a [link][google-es]{:hreflang="es"} in Spanish.

[link]: https://google.com
[google-es]: https://google.es

</div>
</div>

### Special classes

#### Shadow

The CSS class called `shadow` should be used when your image edges are not clearly defined.
This happens when it has a white background or when it's a screenshot with text (for example,
a screenshot of our user interface). For example, this image can be mistaken as part
of the text:

![text screenshot](/images/handbook/marketing/markdown-guide-image-plain-text.png)

Now, if you apply the class `shadow` to the image, it's discreetly highlighted from the text:

![text screenshot with box shadow](/images/handbook/marketing/markdown-guide-image-plain-text.png){: .shadow}

To do that, apply the class directly to the image by adding the markup `{: .shadow}` right after the image
markup:

```md
![image alternative text](/path/to/image.png){: .shadow}
```

#### Note

As [previously](#notes) explained, you can add the class `note` to paragraphs that
you don't want to call attention to:

**Note:** this is something I don't want to call attention to.
{: .note}

Markup:

```md
**Note:** this is something I don't want to call attention to.
{: .note}
```

#### Colors

Add a custom class to a heading or paragraph using the following special classes.

**GitLab Orange**

#### GitLab Orange Heading
{:.gitlab-orange .no_toc}

Markup:

```
### GitLab Orange Heading
{: .gitlab-orange}
```

**GitLab Purple**

#### GitLab Purple Heading
{:.gitlab-purple .no_toc}

Markup:

```
### GitLab Purple Heading
{: .gitlab-purple}
```

#### Text Align

By default, the text will always be aligned to the left. You have a few
options to customize it with custom classes:

- Center: `.text-center`
- Right: `.text-right`
- Justify: `.text-justify`

For demonstrations purposes, they are aligned
in an [alert box](#colorful-sections), but this can be
applied to regular paragraphs and headings.

**Align to the center**

Center-aligned
{: .alert .alert-info .text-center}

Alert box markup:

```md
Center-aligned
{: .alert .alert-info .text-center}
```

Paragraph markup:

```md
Center-aligned
{: .text-center}
```

Heading markup:

```md
### Center-aligned
{: .text-center}
```

**Align to the right**

Right-aligned
{: .alert .alert-info .text-right}

```md
Right-aligned
{: .alert .alert-info .text-right}
```

**Justify**

Justified
{: .alert .alert-info .text-justify}

```md
Justified
{: .alert .alert-info .text-justify}
```

----

## Mix HTML + Markdown Markup

Mixing HTML markup with markdown is something almost "unthinkable" to someone used to regular markdown.
And it's all over this document!

Use the following markup at the beginning of your document:

```md
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
```

And feel free to mix everything up:

```
Something in **markdown**.

<p>Then an HTML tag with crazy **markup** _all over_ the place!</p>
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Something in **markdown**.

<p>Then an HTML tag with crazy **markup** _all over_ the place!</p>

</div>
</div>

You can close the markup parser tag at any point, if you want to:

```md
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
```

----

## Colorful sections

To add notes and warning blocks into colorful boxes,
we are making use of Bootstrap's [panel blocks] and [alert boxes].

Colorful sections are applied for very specific purposes and must not be overused.

Use panels when your description contains more than one paragraph, or a
long paragraph. For single and short paragraphs, use alert boxes instead.

When using panels, make sure to add the HTML parser markup to the beginning of your document's body:
`{::options parse_block_html="true" /}`.
{: #html-parser}

Copy paste the following code according to what you want to present to the user
and replace only the description. The available colors are:
blue (`info`), green (`success`), amber (`warning`) and red (`danger`), as follows.

### Additional Information

Use the following code for **important notes** and additional information:

```html
<div class="panel panel-info">
**Note**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

NOTE DESCRIPTION

</div>
</div>
```

To apply to a single paragraph, use an alert box:

```
My important paragraph.
{: .alert .alert-info}
```

Blue panels render like:

<div class="panel panel-info">
**Note**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
INFO DESCRIPTION
</div>
</div>

And blue alert boxes render like:

My important paragraph.
{: .alert .alert-info}

If you want the text inside the alert box to be blue as well, we need to apply [custom styles](#styles)
to the markdown document. They will override the existing ones. Add the following `style` tag to the end of your file.

```css
<style>
.alert-info {
  color: rgb(49,112,143) !important;
}
</style>
```

### Warnings

Use the following code for warnings, like information that may have a different
result if not used correctly:

```html
<div class="panel panel-warning">
**Warning**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

WARNING DESCRIPTION

</div>
</div>
```

To apply to a single paragraph, use an alert box:

```
My warning paragraph.
{: .alert .alert-warning}
```

Amber panels render like:

<div class="panel panel-warning">
**Warning**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

WARNING DESCRIPTION

</div>
</div>

And amber alert boxes render like:

My warning paragraph.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

If you want the text inside the alert box to be amber as well, we need to apply [custom styles](#styles)
to the markdown document. They will override the existing ones. Add the following `style` tag to the end of your file.

```css
<style>
.alert-warning {
  color: rgb(138,109,59) !important;
}
</style>
```

### Danger

Use the following code for crucial warnings, like commands that result in loss
of data:

```html
<div class="panel panel-danger">
**Danger**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

DANGER DESCRIPTION

</div>
</div>
```

To apply to a single paragraph, use an alert box:

```
My danger paragraph.
{: .alert .alert-danger}
```

Red panels render like:

<div class="panel panel-danger">
**Danger**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
DANGER DESCRIPTION
</div>
</div>

And red alert boxes render like:

My danger paragraph.
{: .alert .alert-danger}

If you want the text inside the alert box to be red as well, we need to apply [custom styles](#styles)
to the markdown document. They will override the existing ones. Add the following `style` tag to the end of your file.

```css
<style>
.alert-danger {
  color: rgb(169,68,66) !important;
}
</style>
```

### Do's and Don'ts

You can use the combination of green and red panels or alert boxes for "Do's and "Don'ts":

```html
<div class="panel panel-success">
**Do's**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

THINGS TO DO

</div>
</div>
```

or, use an alert box:

```
TO DO.
{: .alert .alert-success}
```

Not to do:

```html
<div class="panel panel-danger">
**Don'ts**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

THINGS NOT TO DO

</div>
</div>
```

or, use an alert box:

```
NOT TO DO.
{: .alert .alert-danger}
```

By doing so, the green panels for "DO'S" will look like:

<div class="panel panel-success">
**Do's**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

THINGS TO DO

</div>
</div>

or, if you chose an alert box:

TO DO.
{: .alert .alert-success}

If you want the text inside the alert box to be green as well,
we need to apply [custom styles](#styles)
to the markdown document. They will override the existing ones.
Add the following `style` tag to the end of your file.

```css
<style>
.alert-green {
  color: rgb(60,118,61) !important;
}
</style>
```

And for your "DON'TS" within red panels will look like:

<div class="panel panel-danger">
**Don'ts**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

THINGS NOT TO DO

</div>
</div>

or, if you chose a red alert box:

NOT TO DO.
{: .alert .alert-danger}

### Custom alert panels and alert boxes

All the previously mentioned alert boxes and panels are available by
default by [Bootstrap]. If we want them in a different
color, we need [custom styles](#styles). At [about.GitLab.com], we
can use the orange and the purple one, as follows.

When using panels, don't forget to add to the beginning of your file the
[HTML parser markup](#html-parser) to be able to mix HMTL + Markdown:
`{::options parse_block_html="true" /}`.

#### GitLab Orange Alert Panel

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-orange">
**Heading**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Text in markdown.
</div>
</div>

Panel block markup:

```html
<div class="panel panel-gitlab-orange">
**Heading**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

Text in markdown.

</div>
</div>
```

#### GitLab Orange Alert Box

My text in an orange box.
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}

Box block markup:

```md
My text in an orange box.
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}
```

#### GitLab Purple Alert Panel

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-purple">
**Heading**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Text in markdown.
</div>
</div>

Panel block markup:

```html
<div class="panel panel-gitlab-purple">
**Heading**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

Text in markdown.

</div>
</div>
```

#### GitLab Purple Alert Box

My text in an purple box.
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-purple}

Box block markup:

```md
My text in an purple box.
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-purple}
```

### GitLab Webcast Alert Box

To be used in a CTA for webcast announcement in blog posts.
You can use it for other purposes as well. Use it together with the [HMTL parser](#html-parser):

<i class="fa fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The webcast I want to announce - [Register here][webcast-link]!
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>
{: .alert .alert-webcast}

[webcast-link]: #

```md
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<i class="fa fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The webcast I want to announce - [Register here][webcast-link]!
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-gitlab" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i>
{: .alert .alert-webcast}
```

----

## Styles

Yes, guess what?

This:

```css
<style>
  .purple {
    color:inherit;
  }
  .purple:hover {
    color:rgb(107,79,187);
  }
</style>
```

<style>
  .purple {
    color:inherit;
  }
  .purple:hover {
    color:rgb(107,79,187);
  }
</style>

Plus:

```
Hey! Hover the cursor over me and guess what?! :)
{: .purple}
```

Equals to:

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Hey! Hover the cursor over me and guess what?! :)
{: .purple}

</div>
</div>

And yes, the `<style>` tag is _in_ this very markdown file. Believe it or not!

----

## Embed documents

It's easy to embed Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and pretty much everything that
provides an iframe to use with. The only thing you need to do is use the
following code inside your markdown file and replace the iframe from the document
you want to embed:

```html
<figure class="video_container">
<iframe IFRAME CONTENT></iframe>
</figure>
```

### Google products

For Google products, with your document opened, click **File** -> **Publish to the web**.
For example here's how Google sheets will look like:

![Google Sheets - File - Publish to the web](/images/markdown-guide/file-publish-to-the-web.png)

Choose **Embed**, check your settings, click on **Publish** and copy the `<iframe>`.
Then go to your markdown file and wrap the iframe into a `<figure>` tag with the
responsive `video_container` class, as shown [in the beginning](#embed-documents).

#### Google Sheets

Let's exemplify with this [simple spreadsheet]. Follow the info [above](#google-products) to find the iframe:

![Google Sheets - Embed iframe](/images/markdown-guide/embed-google-sheet.png)

Copy the code below and paste to your markdown file (leave a blank line above and below it). Then replace the `<iframe>` with your own:

```html
<figure class="video_container">
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAnvYpRmNu8BISIrkYGTLolOTmlCoKLbuHVWzCXJSY4/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
</figure>
```

#### Output:
{: .no_toc}

<figure class="video_container">
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAnvYpRmNu8BISIrkYGTLolOTmlCoKLbuHVWzCXJSY4/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
</figure>

<br>

#### Google Slides

Let's exemplify with this [GitLab deck template]. Follow the steps [above](#embed-documents) to find the iframe:

![Google Slides - Embed iframe](/images/markdown-guide/embed-google-slides.png)

Copy the code below and paste to your markdown file (leave a blank line above and below it). Then replace the `<iframe>` with your own:

```html
<figure class="video_container">
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ux0yeJpJooWgq1_UROeAbbM3nNYFiF_iU26P3msPdzU/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="1280" height="749" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>
```

#### Output:
{: .no_toc}

<figure class="video_container">
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ux0yeJpJooWgq1_UROeAbbM3nNYFiF_iU26P3msPdzU/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="1280" height="749" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>

<br>

#### Google Docs

Embedding Google Docs is not a recommended practice. Prefer converting your document content
to markdown instead. If you need to embed it anyway, follow the same instructions and the same logic as
we presented for Google Sheets and Slides, wrapping the `<iframe>` with a `<figure>` tag:

```html
<figure class="video_container">
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHhOhvvrz7xgUPyn5VWCNuKgew5MRRGZp761B9prPqs/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
</figure>
```

### SlideShare

To embed from SlideShare, go to the document you want to embed and hit the **Share**
button located below the slides. Copy the code under **Embed** and place it
inside the `figure` tag.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: rgb(138, 109, 59)
;"></i> Be careful to only include the iframe content and strip anything else.
SlideShare will also add some other information in the embed code which you
will have to remove, otherwise the markdown page will be broken.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

For example, let's say we wanted to include the slides from [Ivan's talk on
GitLab Pages][slideshare-ivan].  Copying the embed code and stripping everything
else except from the iframe, would result in this:

```html
<figure>
<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/EixD8OUMBX65Jy" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</figure>
```

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: rgb(49, 112, 143)
;"></i> You can safely omit the `<figure>` tag since SlideShare's widget is
already responsive, but we are showing this that way in order to be consistent
with the rest of the handbook.
{: .alert .alert-info}

#### Output:
{: .no_toc}

<figure>
<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/EixD8OUMBX65Jy" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</figure>

## Embed Tweets

To add tweets to markdown, copy both `<blockquote>` and `<script>` tags
from the twitter post and paste it into your file. To make it look much
nicer, wrap the script into a `div.center` (created for this specific purpose).

**Important:** if you used the [HTML parser](#mix-html--markdown-markup) in your
post or page, you'll need to set it to `false` before the `div`.
{:.alert .alert-info}

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

<div class="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gitlab">@gitlab</a> for joining <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj">@RailsGirlsCluj</a>! <a href="https://t.co/NOoiqDWKVY">pic.twitter.com/NOoiqDWKVY</a></p>&mdash; RailsGirlsCluj (@RailsGirlsCluj) <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj/status/784847271645028352">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>
<br>

Markup:

```md
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

<div class="center">

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gitlab">@gitlab</a> for joining <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj">@RailsGirlsCluj</a>! <a href="https://t.co/NOoiqDWKVY">pic.twitter.com/NOoiqDWKVY</a></p>&mdash; RailsGirlsCluj (@RailsGirlsCluj) <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj/status/784847271645028352">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

</div>
```

For more than one Tweet, copy and paste all the code blocks from Twitter into one `div.center`:

```md
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

<div class="center">

<!-- first tweet -->
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gitlab">@gitlab</a> for joining <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj">@RailsGirlsCluj</a>! <a href="https://t.co/NOoiqDWKVY">pic.twitter.com/NOoiqDWKVY</a></p>&mdash; RailsGirlsCluj (@RailsGirlsCluj) <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj/status/784847271645028352">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!-- second tweet -->
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gitlab">@gitlab</a> for joining <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj">@RailsGirlsCluj</a>! <a href="https://t.co/NOoiqDWKVY">pic.twitter.com/NOoiqDWKVY</a></p>&mdash; RailsGirlsCluj (@RailsGirlsCluj) <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsCluj/status/784847271645028352">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

</div>
```

## Markdown Editors

Please use one of the following code editors to write in markdown, or another **code editor** of
your preference.

It is **not** recommend writing your document in a regular text editor, then copy-pasting to markdown,
as it most likely will bring some characters with a different encoding (non UTF-8), which will cause the
markdown to not render correctly.

In case you don't have a choice and need to import a text already written in a text editor, paste it
to your markdown file using **command+shift+V** on a Mac, or **control+shift+V** on Windows or Linux.
You might minimize the cause of trouble by pasting without format. But yet, is not guaranteed it
is going to work, so double check your HTML output.

_Regular Code Editors_

- [Sublime Text 3][sublime]
- [Atom]

_Markdown editors (type and preview simultaneously)_

- Markdown editors for Mac: [Mou], [iA Writer]
- In-browser markdown editor: [StackEdit]

If you're not used to writing markdown, those editors can be helpful. Check a screenshot below of a
file being edited on Mou. On your left, there's the markdown markup you're writing, and on your right,
a preview of the output. The preview won't be exactly as the final result, but it's a very good
approximation, which gives you a good idea on what you're doing while you type.

[StackEdit] is awesome too, you can work on a markdown file even if you're away from your computer,
or out of resources. It works from every major browser and automatically saves your work to Google Drive.

## Complementary Notes
{: #tips--tricks}

- Words must be separated by one single space only. Do not leave more blank spaces than the necessary,
they can render differently than expected and can cause other issues.
- Do not leave blank spaces at the end of sentences.
- {:#jump-a-line} Always leave a blank line between block-level markup elements, except between list items. Example:

        ---- (markup for horizontal line)
        <!-- blank line -->
        Paragraph.
        <!-- blank line -->
        Do not leave blank lines within list items:
        <!-- blank line -->
        - Item 1
        - Item 2
        - Item 3
    {: .language-html}

- As explained [above](#headings), do **not** skip headings. Always do h1 &rarr; h2 &rarr; h3 &rarr; h4. Never h2 &rarr; h4.
- Prefer short titles and headings. Do not punctuate them (unless they require a question mark or an exclamation).
- Try not to punctuate list items, but if you do, be consistent and do that throughout the list.
- If you have to mention a non-clickable URL, prefer using backticks: `http://an-example.com`.
- To add fancy emojis to your file, click `control+cmd+space` on your Mac and check the ⭐️ **magic**! ⭐️ Do not overuse them, please!
- If you are confused about any markup that you've found in this file, you can check its [`raw` file] for reference,
where you'll be able to see exactly how everything was written to produce the results you are seeing on this page.
